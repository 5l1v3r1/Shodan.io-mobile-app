# Shodan.io-mobile-app
Official repository for the Shodan.io mobile Application

The Android version can actually be found [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.shodan.app). 
The iOS version is on its way and should be available in the next few weeks. 

# Why that repo? 

In order to ask for specific feature, please open an issue and ask for it. 
I will take some time to dev it and push it on both Google Play and iOS store. 

# How? 

This app has been built using the [ionic framework](http://ionicframework.com/) which is basically using [PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com/) and [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/) but also includes [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) to build hybrid application (HTML5 + JavaScript basically).
